**About Us**

Box Stream TV was born from a simple observation: boxing promoters are great at packing the house, but what about all the fans who can't make it to the venue? And let's be honest—getting quality event footage shouldn't cost an arm and a leg.

That's where we come in. Founded by Ryan Ross (sports video production pro with years in the game) and Hunter Coleman (full-stack developer and tech wizard), Box Stream TV offers a solution that's a win-win for everyone.

**Here's how it works:**
Instead of paying big upfront fees for production, we stream your event live and split the PPV revenue with you. You get professional, multi-camera coverage, we capture high-quality footage you can use to promote future events, and fans around the world get to watch the action—everyone wins.

Ryan brings the cameras, the skills, and years of production know-how. Hunter brings the tech to make sure your stream runs smoothly every single time. Together, we make streaming your event easy and profitable.
